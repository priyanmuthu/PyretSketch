Compute the length of a list:
my-len :: List<Any> -> Number
Compute the sum of a list (of numbers):
my-sum :: List<Number> -> Number
Compute the maximum of a list (of numbers or strings):
my-max :: List<Any> -> Any
Given a list of strings, convert each string to a number representing its length:
my-str-len :: List<String> -> List<Number>
Given a list of numbers, generate a list of its positive numbers:
If you want to be pedantic: its positive numbers with the same count and in the same order.
my-pos-nums :: List<Number> -> List<Number>
Given a list of numbers, replace every element with the running sum, i.e., the sum of all the elements from the beginning of the list until that element (inclusive):
my-running-sum :: List<Number> -> List<Number>
Given a list, keep every alternate element in it, starting from the first:
my-alternating :: List<Any> -> List<Any>
Given a list of numbers, compute the average of the numbers:
my-avg :: List<Number> -> List<Number>
